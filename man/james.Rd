\description{
Contains results of an example analysis performed with the JAMES extensions
module. The performance of two algorithms is compared (random descent and
parallel tempering) for a core selection problem in which the mean
entry-to-nearest-entry distance is maximized. Four different data sets have
been analyzed. Details about the performed analysis are provided at the
website (see below).
